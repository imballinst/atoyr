# AGS Extend MCP Installer

Wire the two AGS Extend MCP servers (`ags-api` and `ags-extend-sdk`) into the user's AI IDE so the IDE can query AGS directly and pull Extend SDK context during code generation.

> Use this subskill for IDEs that do not ship with plugin-managed MCPs, or whose plugin support doesn't cover the SDK MCP. That currently includes: Claude Code (file-scoped), Cursor, Windsurf, and Kiro.
>
> Codex is handled separately because it uses `.codex/config.toml` instead of the JSON `mcpServers` files below.

## Behavior Constraints

<grounding_rules>

- Each supported IDE has a specific config path and JSON structure — use exactly the structure given in this file. Do not blend Cursor's shape into Claude Code's file or vice versa.
- The two server commands (both Docker images) are fixed. Do not substitute alternate packages, versions, or images without user direction.
- Do not invent env var names. Each server reads a specific set of env vars listed below.

</grounding_rules>

<tool_usage_rules>

- Use `Read` to check whether a config file already exists and what's inside it.
- Use `Edit` to merge new server entries into an existing file — **never** overwrite. Preserve existing `mcpServers` entries, other top-level keys, and formatting.
- Use `Write` only to create a config file when none exists.
- Do not touch anything outside the target config file. Do not modify shell profiles, environment files, or the user's global git config.

</tool_usage_rules>

<dependency_checks>

Before merging the config, check:

| Dependency | Required for | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| Docker daemon running | Both servers | `docker info` |

If Docker isn't running, stop and tell the user to start Docker before continuing.

</dependency_checks>

<action_safety>

Show the exact JSON that will be merged before making any change. Show the target file path. Ask yes/no.

On conflict (`ags-api` or `ags-extend-sdk` key already exists in the user's `mcpServers`), do not overwrite — surface both the existing entry and the proposed one, and ask which to keep.

Never commit the config file to git (the user's responsibility, but don't encourage it either).

</action_safety>

<output_contract>

Final output is a "Done." block that lists:

1. The config file modified (full path).
2. Which servers were added, skipped, or kept as-is.
3. The env vars the user still needs to set before restarting their IDE.
4. The instruction to restart the IDE.

</output_contract>

## MCP Servers

## Migration Note

If the user previously copied an older plugin-generated MCP config into their IDE, inspect any existing `ags-extend-sdk` entry before keeping it. Older entries may pass Docker `-e CONFIG_DIR` without a value. Remove the stale entry and re-run `/ags-extend install-mcp` or `/ags-extend init` so the config embeds the selected SDK language value.

### ags-api

Exposes AccelByte Gaming Services API operations — query players, namespaces, entitlements, events, and other AGS resources from the IDE.

- **Command:** `docker run -d -e AB_BASE_URL=<url> -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-api-mcp-server:2026.2.0`
- **Requires:** Docker daemon running
- **Transport:** HTTP — connect the IDE to `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- **Auth:** OAuth handled via discovery — no `AB_CLIENT_ID` or `AB_CLIENT_SECRET` needed in IDE config

### ags-extend-sdk

Exposes AccelByte Extend SDK functions and models as context for AI code generation. Per-language — the `CONFIG_DIR` env var selects which SDK surface is loaded.

- **Command:** `docker run -i --rm -e CONFIG_DIR ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-extend-sdk-mcp-server:2026.2.0`
- **Requires:** Docker daemon running, image pullable from ghcr.io
- **Env vars:** `CONFIG_DIR` (one of `config/go`, `config/java`, `config/python`, `config/csharp`)

## Workflow

### Codex-only config handling

Use this section only when the user is running Codex. Codex requires project-scoped TOML entries in `<project>/.codex/config.toml`; do not ask Codex users to merge `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, or `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`.

For Codex, add or update only the needed MCP server tables:

```toml
[mcp_servers.ags_api]
url = "http://localhost:3000/mcp"

[mcp_servers.ags_extend_sdk]
command = "docker"
args = ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "CONFIG_DIR", "ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-extend-sdk-mcp-server:2026.2.0"]
```

Before writing config, tell the user to start the ags-api container first:

```bash
docker run -d -e AB_BASE_URL=<url> -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-api-mcp-server:2026.2.0
```

Tell the user to provide `CONFIG_DIR` for ags-extend-sdk through the environment Codex runs in. After writing config, tell the user to restart Codex or reload MCP servers. The setup is not verified until Codex shows tools for the configured servers or the underlying commands start without immediate configuration errors.

If the user is not running Codex, skip this section and use the IDE-specific JSON workflow below.

### Step 1 — Identify the IDE

If the user's invocation names an IDE (e.g. "install mcp for Cursor"), use that. Otherwise ask:

> Which AI IDE are you setting up? (Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf / Kiro / other)

If "other," show the generic `ags-api` + `ags-extend-sdk` JSON and tell the user to paste it into their IDE's MCP config — this subskill only auto-merges for the four named IDEs.

### Step 2 — Check dependencies

Run `docker info`. Report:

```
  ✓ docker daemon running
```

or

```
  ✗ docker daemon not running — both servers require Docker. Start Docker and retry.
```

If Docker isn't running, stop here without writing anything.

### Step 3 — Pick SDK language

If `ags-extend-sdk` will be installed, ask (unless the user already said):

> Which language is your Extend app in? (Go / Java / Python / C#)

Map to `CONFIG_DIR`:

| Language | CONFIG_DIR |
|---|---|
| Go | `config/go` |
| Java | `config/java` |
| Python | `config/python` |
| C# | `config/csharp` |

If the user is working inside an Extend app directory (`Makefile` + `Dockerfile` present), detect the language from on-disk files (`go.mod` → Go, `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python, `*.csproj` → C#, `build.gradle` / `pom.xml` → Java) and use that as the default suggestion — still confirm with the user.

### Step 4 — Resolve the config file

| IDE | Preferred file | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `<project>/.mcp.json` (project-scoped) | `~/.claude.json` (global) |
| Cursor | `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json` (project) | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | — |
| Kiro | `<project>/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (project) | `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (global) |

Ask which scope to use when both exist (project vs global). If neither scope is clearly correct, default to project-scoped — it keeps the config alongside the app.

Read the file if it exists. Parse its JSON. Check for `mcpServers.ags-api` and `mcpServers.ags-extend-sdk`.

### Step 5 — Show the merge plan

```
Will add these MCP servers to {config-file}:

  1. ags-api          — AGS API operations
  2. ags-extend-sdk   — Extend SDK context (CONFIG_DIR = {config-dir})

{"with existing entries preserved" or "creating new file"}

Continue? (yes/no)
```

If either key already exists, show both the existing entry and the new one, then ask which to keep. Treat "skip" as "leave existing alone, add the other."

### Step 6 — Write

Merge by reading the existing JSON, inserting the new entries under `mcpServers`, and writing the file back. Preserve any other top-level keys (`tools`, `features`, etc.) and surrounding whitespace/indentation when possible.

#### Claude Code (`.mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json`)

Start the ags-api container before configuring the IDE:

```bash
docker run -d -e AB_BASE_URL="${AB_BASE_URL:-https://demo.accelbyte.io}" -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-api-mcp-server:2026.2.0
```

Then add via CLI: `claude mcp add --transport http ags-api http://localhost:3000/mcp`

Or write directly to the config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ags-api": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    },
    "ags-extend-sdk": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "CONFIG_DIR", "ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-extend-sdk-mcp-server:2026.2.0"],
      "env": {
        "CONFIG_DIR": "${CONFIG_DIR:-{config-dir}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json`)

Start the ags-api container first (see Claude Code section above). Then:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ags-api": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    },
    "ags-extend-sdk": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "CONFIG_DIR", "ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-extend-sdk-mcp-server:2026.2.0"],
      "env": {
        "CONFIG_DIR": "{config-dir}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windsurf (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`)

Start the ags-api container first (see Claude Code section above). Then:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ags-api": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    },
    "ags-extend-sdk": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "CONFIG_DIR", "ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-extend-sdk-mcp-server:2026.2.0"],
      "env": {
        "CONFIG_DIR": "${env:CONFIG_DIR}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Kiro (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, project or global)

Same JSON structure as Claude Code above.

### Step 7 — Check authentication

If the active IDE exposes either AccelByte MCP server after setup, run one lightweight read-only call to confirm authentication. If the tools are unavailable until restart, defer the check until the IDE reloads.

If sign-in fails with an invalid-client signature — "invalid client ID", "client ID not found", or IAM's generic "Invalid Request" page — the cached DCR registration may be stale. Read `../../accelbyte/references/mcp-auth-recovery.md`, confirm the surrounding evidence, and follow its client-specific recovery. Do not reinstall or re-add the MCP server. Do not clear authentication for an ordinary expired token; try normal refresh or re-authorization first.

### Step 8 — Post-install reminder

```
Done. MCP config updated:
  {config-file-path}

Added:
  ✓ ags-api
  ✓ ags-extend-sdk (CONFIG_DIR = {config-dir})

The ags-api container must be running before starting your IDE. Start it with:

  docker run -d -e AB_BASE_URL=<your-ags-url> -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/accelbyte/ags-api-mcp-server:2026.2.0

For ags-extend-sdk, set CONFIG_DIR in your environment. It is already embedded in
the config — update {config-file-path} if you change languages later.

Restart {IDE} for the new MCP connections to activate.
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| Config file exists but isn't valid JSON | Stop. Show the parse error and the line. Do not auto-fix user JSON. |
| `mcpServers` key exists with a non-object value (e.g. array, null) | Stop. The user has an unusual config — show what's there and ask for guidance. |
| `ags-api` already present, different command | Show both entries, ask which to keep. Don't auto-pick either. |
| `ags-extend-sdk` present with a different image tag | Treat as above; mention that newer tags exist (the one in this file) but let the user decide. |
| User picks a language not in the table | Stop — the SDK MCP supports only the four listed. Ask again. |
| Docker is installed but daemon not running | Both servers require Docker. Tell the user to start Docker and retry. |
| Sign-in fails with "invalid client ID", "client ID not found", or a generic IAM "Invalid Request" page | The cached DCR client registration may be stale. Read `../../accelbyte/references/mcp-auth-recovery.md`, confirm its evidence, and follow the client-specific recovery. Do not reinstall or re-add the MCP server, and do not clear authentication for an ordinary expired token. |
| Windsurf path doesn't exist yet | Create it (and the `~/.codeium/windsurf/` directory). Don't fall back to a different file. |
| User wants both project and global configs | Pick one for this run. Say: "I'll write one at a time — re-run `/ags-extend install-mcp` and choose the other scope if you want both." |
| "other" IDE | Print the generic JSON block and the required env vars. Stop without writing. |

       don't want to guess. Here's the generic config. Paste it into Zed's
       MCP configuration, adjust env vars as needed:

         [JSON block]

       Required env vars: AB_BASE_URL, AB_CLIENT_ID, AB_CLIENT_SECRET, CONFIG_DIR.
       See Zed's MCP docs for the exact config location and merge rules.
```
