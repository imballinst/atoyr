# ags

The default landing skill for AccelByte Gaming Services (AGS). One entry point — `/ags <subskill>` — covers everything from understanding what AGS is, to bootstrapping a namespace, integrating the SDK, debugging a live setup, planning Matchmaking, operating AMS fleets, and deciding whether you need to expand into Extend, ADT, or Access.

For Extend-specific work (Override / Event Handler / Service Extension / App UI), use `/ags-extend` instead. This skill defers the entire Extend lifecycle there.

For new Matchmaking and AMS work, use `/ags matchmaking ...` and `/ags ams ...`. Legacy Matchmaking and AMS compatibility shims remain for one release.

---

## Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> - **/ags init** - start here for a clean-slate setup. It scans the current project, detects the engine or app type, and guides the setup for AGS configuration, SDKs, the AGS CLI, MCP servers, namespace access, and IAM client settings
> - **/ags <prompt>** - use this for every question, goal, or symptom after that, such as `/ags help me add login and matchmaking` or `/ags debug why tickets are timing out`.

---

## Intended Workflow

```
 0. ask            — understand what AGS is and which modules cover your needs
 1. explore        — read-only walkthrough of an existing namespace (optional)
 2. wizard         — interview → pick modules + SDK + target platforms
 3. connect-portal — bootstrap a namespace + IAM client + .env
 4. install-sdk    — detect SDK target and install Unreal, Unity, Godot, Roblox, Web SDK, or custom-engine REST fallback
    generate-ui    — detect engine and generate AGS UI where supported
 5. install-cli    — install the AGS CLI
 6. install-mcp    — customize the AGS API MCP URL (Shared Cloud / per-studio / Private Cloud). The MCP server itself ships with the plugin.
 7. integrate      — module-by-module SDK wiring (auth, lobby, matchmaking, store, …)
 8. debug          — run the game locally and trace integration failures
 9. observe        — pull logs, metrics, and events from a live namespace
10. doctor         — read-only diagnosis when something's off
11. handoff        — decide when to bring in ags-extend, ADT, Access, or deeper AGS capabilities
```

`init` runs steps 2–6 end-to-end for a clean-slate setup.

`ask`, `explore`, `doctor`, and `handoff` are read-only and can be invoked at any phase. `ask` answers concept questions; `explore` walks an existing namespace; `doctor` narrows symptoms to a cause and hands off to whatever subskill owns the fix; `handoff` decides whether `/ags` is even the right skill, whether you should use `/ags ams ...`, whether Access packaging under IAM fits, or whether you should be in `/ags-extend`, `/adt`, or talking to AccelByte sales.

`install-mcp` is optional. It connects your AI IDE to AGS so the IDE can query the AccelByte API and reference SDK context while you code. Best set up before step 7 if you want it.

`install-cli` is a prerequisite for some `connect-portal` and `observe` flows. If you skip it, those subskills will detect the missing CLI and prompt you to run it.

## Subskills

| Subskill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ask` | Answers questions about AGS — modules, deployment models, pricing shape, how it compares to EOS / PlayFab / DIY |
| `explore` | Read-only walkthrough of a customer's existing namespace: which modules are enabled, which IAM clients exist, which environments are configured |
| `wizard` | Interview-driven planning: which modules you need, which SDK fits your engine, which target platforms, and a starter integration plan |
| `connect-portal` | Bootstraps a namespace + IAM client + `.env` file for a new project |
| `install-sdk` | Detects the target SDK and installs/scaffolds Unreal, Unity, Godot, Roblox, the standalone **TypeScript Web SDK**, or custom-engine REST fallback. Unreal and Unity specifics live in engine references under `references/sdks/game-engine/`. **Extend SDKs (Go, Python, C#, Java) are owned by `/ags-extend`** — they're for Extend apps, not game clients. |
| `generate-ui` | Detects the game engine and routes AGS UI generation to the engine-specific workflow. Unreal is supported through `AccelByteUITools`; Unity is supported through the AccelByte Unity MCP server; Godot is explicitly unsupported for now. |
| `install-cli` | Installs the AGS CLI for namespace + IAM management |
| `install-mcp` | Picks and applies the right AGS API MCP URL for the user's deployment (Shared Cloud default / per-studio / Private Cloud). The MCP entry itself ships with the plugin via `content/mcps/ags-api.yaml`; this subskill is the URL-customization conversation. |
| `init` | End-to-end setup: runs wizard → connect-portal → install-sdk → install-cli → optional install-mcp |
| `integrate` | Module-by-module SDK wiring guide — auth, lobby, matchmaking, sessions, store, statistics, leaderboards, achievements, social, analytics |
| `debug` | Runs a game locally against AGS and traces integration failures (auth errors, lobby disconnects, matchmaking timeouts) |
| `observe` | Fetches logs, metrics, and event signals from a deployed namespace |
| `doctor` | Read-only symptom → cause diagnosis; hands off to the subskill that owns the fix |
| `handoff` | Decides when AGS isn't the right tool for the request, when to use internal `/ags ams ...`, when Access packaging under IAM fits, and when to point at `/ags-extend`, `/adt`, or AccelByte support |

## Notes

- This skill is the **default entry point** for AccelByte questions, including deep Matchmaking and AMS work. Use `/ags matchmaking ...` and `/ags ams ...` for those lifecycles. Legacy Matchmaking and AMS compatibility shims remain for one release.
- Architecture clarification: Extend, AMS, and Matchmaking are *part of* AGS; Matchmaking and AMS now live under this canonical `/ags` entry point. Extend still has its own lifecycle skill, ADT is the only true sibling product, and Access is the standalone packaging of AGS IAM (a strict subset).
- Subskills are kept small. When a topic has multiple sub-areas (modules, SDKs, deployment, ecosystem), the subskill points into the right `references/` subdirectory rather than inlining everything.
- `references/modules/` covers the most common integration modules (IAM, Lobby, Matchmaking, Session, Statistics, Leaderboards, Achievements, Store/Entitlements, Analytics, Social) plus the generic TURN/STUN/P2P connectivity model. AGS has many additional modules (Cloud Save, Inventory, Rewards, Season Pass, Challenges, UGC, Chat, Guilds & Clans, Multiplayer Notifications, Legal & Privacy, and more) that are not covered by dedicated reference files here — point users to `https://docs.accelbyte.io/gaming-services/modules/` for the full list.
- `references/ecosystem/` is intentionally light — those files tell you *when* to bring in another capability router, workflow, skill, or product, not *how* to use it. The actual usage docs live in the owning capability, skill, or AccelByte's docs.
- `connect-portal` does not create production namespaces autonomously. It produces the IAM client and `.env` configuration; namespace creation and tier upgrades stay in the Admin Portal flow with an authorized human in the loop.
- Pricing references (PCCU bands, tier descriptions) are illustrative and grounded in AccelByte's published pricing. They go stale; subskills always point users at `https://accelbyte.io/pricing` for the current numbers rather than quoting them as authoritative.
