# AGS Namespace Explorer

Read-only inspection of an existing AGS setup. Surfaces which modules are turned on, which IAM clients exist, which environments are wired, and which platform identity providers are configured — so the user can plan changes from a known starting point rather than guessing.

This subskill **never modifies anything.** No portal changes, no IAM client creation, no namespace edits. If the user wants to make changes, hand off to `/ags connect-portal` (for IAM / namespace work), `/ags integrate` (for SDK / module wiring), or the relevant peer skill.

## Behavior Constraints

<grounding_rules>

Walk the user through their *actual* setup, grounded in:

- Files on disk that describe the integration (`.env`, SDK config files, Admin Portal export files if available).
- Output of read-only AGS CLI queries (when the CLI is installed and authenticated).
- The user's stated context.

Don't fabricate findings. If something can't be inspected (e.g. CLI not installed, no `.env` file), say so and offer the alternative — usually "look in the Admin Portal".

</grounding_rules>

<tool_usage_rules>

- Use `Read` and `Glob` to find AGS-related config files in the project (`.env`, `accelbyte.config.*`, SDK plugin folders, etc.).
- Use `Bash` for read-only commands only - `ags auth status`, `ags doctor`, `ags describe`, and generated list/get/show commands. **Never** use it for `create`, `delete`, `update`, or any state-changing operation.
- Follow `references/observe/cli-commands.md#rules-of-engagement-for-llms` when discovering generated AGS CLI commands: use `ags describe` first and prefer `--format json` for command output.
- Don't read references unless the user asks a conceptual question mid-walkthrough.
- Don't read other subskills.

</tool_usage_rules>

<action_safety>

This subskill is read-only by contract. If the user asks for a change mid-walkthrough:

1. Stop the walkthrough.
2. Tell the user which subskill owns the change (`/ags connect-portal` for IAM, `/ags integrate` for SDK wiring, peer skills for their own surfaces).
3. Don't make the change here even if it's small.

</action_safety>

<output_contract>

End with a single summary block:

```
Namespace setup found:

  Environments:        <list>
  Default namespace:   <name>
  IAM clients:         <count> public, <count> confidential
  Platform IdPs:       <list>
  Modules in use:      <list> (inferred from SDK config / IAM scopes / observed traffic)
  CLI installed:       yes / no
  MCP wired:           yes / no

Notable gaps / observations:
  • <bullet>
  • <bullet>

Next-step pointers:
  • <subskill or peer skill>
```

If the user explicitly wants more detail on one of the items, dive in there. Otherwise the summary block is the deliverable.

</output_contract>

<completeness_contract>

The walkthrough is complete when:

- Environments and namespaces are identified (or noted as "couldn't determine").
- IAM client count and types are listed (or noted as "couldn't query").
- The modules in use are inferred and listed (best-effort inference from SDK config / IAM scopes).
- Notable gaps (missing config, unsupported scopes for a feature the user mentions, dev-token-against-prod situations) are surfaced.
- Pointers are given for next steps.

A walkthrough that couldn't inspect everything still completes — just say "couldn't determine" for items that aren't visible.

</completeness_contract>

## Workflow

1. **Find AGS config on disk.** Look for `.env`, `accelbyte.config.*`, SDK plugin folders, build configs that reference `accelbyte` URLs. List what's found.
2. **Identify environments and namespaces** from those configs. Distinguish dev / staging / prod where possible.
3. **If the AGS CLI is installed and authenticated:** run read-only queries:
   - `ags auth status` and `ags doctor`.
   - `ags describe <service> <resource> <method>` before generated service commands.
   - `ags iam clients list --namespace <name>` for each namespace if the current specs expose that command.
   - `ags session game-sessions list --namespace <name>` if the user is interested in active session count and the current specs expose that command.
   - Check which platform IdPs are configured.
4. **If the CLI isn't installed:** point at `/ags install-cli` and continue with what's visible from disk.
5. **Infer modules in use** from:
   - The SDK plugin / package set imported (e.g. `IAccelByteUe4Sdk*`, npm imports).
   - IAM client scopes (which AGS APIs the IAM client can access).
   - Observed code paths (matchmaking calls, lobby calls, store calls).
6. **Surface notable gaps** — common patterns:
   - Dev token configured against prod URL or vice versa.
   - Public IAM client used in a server build (or vice versa).
   - Missing platform IdP for a target the user said they're shipping on.
   - SDK version pinned far behind current.
7. **Print the summary block** per `output_contract`.
8. **Offer next-step pointers** based on the gaps, e.g. "the dev/prod URL mismatch belongs in `/ags connect-portal`."

## Examples

### Happy path (full info)

```
User: /ags explore — what's set up here?

Skill: [reads .env, accelbyte.config.json, runs ags auth status and a read-only IAM query]

       Namespace setup found:

         Environments:        dev, staging, prod
         Default namespace:   "myteam-dev"
         IAM clients:         2 public, 1 confidential
         Platform IdPs:       Steam, Apple, Google
         Modules in use:      IAM, Lobby, Matchmaking, Sessions, Store
         CLI installed:       yes
         MCP wired:           no

       Notable gaps:
         • PSN IdP is not configured but the README mentions PS5 launch.
         • SDK version pinned to 18.x; current release is 22.x.

       Next-step pointers:
         • PSN IdP setup: /ags connect-portal
         • SDK upgrade: /ags install-sdk (will detect the upgrade path)
         • Customize MCP URL (optional, only if not on Shared Cloud default): /ags install-mcp
```

### Limited info (CLI not installed)

```
User: /ags explore

Skill: [reads .env]

       Namespace setup found:

         Environments:        dev (URL points at the dev cluster)
         Default namespace:   "myteam-dev"
         IAM clients:         couldn't query — AGS CLI not installed
         Platform IdPs:       couldn't query — AGS CLI not installed
         Modules in use:      IAM, Lobby (inferred from imports in pkg/)
         CLI installed:       no
         MCP wired:           no

       Notable gaps:
         • No staging or prod environment configured.
         • AGS CLI not installed — can't verify IAM client setup.

       Next-step pointers:
         • Install the CLI: /ags install-cli (then re-run /ags explore for
           the full picture).
         • Set up staging / prod environments: /ags connect-portal.
```

## Error handling

- **No AGS config found on disk** — say so. Ask the user whether they've started integrating yet; if not, route to `/ags wizard`.
- **CLI installed but not authenticated** — surface the auth step (`ags auth login`) but don't run it for the user (it's interactive).
- **Conflicting config files** (e.g. two `.env` files with different namespaces) — list both and note the conflict.
- **User asks for a change mid-walkthrough** — see `action_safety`. Stop, route to the right subskill.
