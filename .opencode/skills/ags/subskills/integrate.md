# AGS Module Integration

Wire individual AGS modules into the project — IAM auth flow first, then everything else. Reads the per-module references and applies them to the user's specific engine and codebase.

If the user provides or references an approved wizard plan document from `docs/ags-plans/`, execute that plan first. The wizard plan is the contract for the requested feature slice; the generic module order below is the fallback when no approved plan document is supplied.

For game-project integration, do not edit code until an approved Game Flow Plan exists or the user explicitly asks for smoke-only work. If no approved Game Flow Plan exists, stop and route back to `workflows/online-game-flow.md`. Module smoke tests are service evidence, not the product outcome.

This subskill assumes the SDK is installed and the test login works. If not, route to `/ags install-sdk`; it owns Unreal, Unity, Godot, Roblox, Web SDK, and custom-engine REST fallback.

Do not satisfy this prerequisite by calling the Unreal SDK MCP server's `install_unreal_sdk` tool. The Unreal SDK MCP is for SDK symbol/snippet/example lookup during integration; AGS SDK installation flow control belongs to the AGS subskills.

If AGS namespace/IAM settings are missing or placeholder-only, do not add code that merely fails more clearly. Route to `/ags connect-portal`; it owns AGS CLI-backed namespace/IAM setup, login-method enablement, `.env`, and engine config values.

## Behavior Constraints

<grounding_rules>

Module behavior must trace to `references/modules/<name>.md`. Cross-module flows (Lobby ↔ Matchmaking ↔ Sessions ↔ AMS) trace to `references/integrate/lobby-session.md`. Auth flow specifics trace to `references/integrate/auth-flow.md`.

Read `../workflows/online-game-flow.md` for player-facing login, matchmaking, session join, or DS/P2P travel requests.

Before implementing storage for player/game data, choose the most purpose-built AGS service first. Read `../references/catalogs/marketing-to-service.md` when the right service is not obvious, then prefer native modules such as Statistics, Leaderboards, Achievements, Store/Entitlements, Inventory, Rewards, Challenges, Legal, GDPR, Lobby/Friends/Presence, Session, Matchmaking, Analytics, UGC, or Chat when the requested behavior matches them. Treat Cloud Save as a generic key-value fallback for save blobs, player preferences, drafts, snapshots, or custom data that does not need native AGS behavior. Do not create Cloud Save records to emulate stats, rankings, achievements, legal agreements, inventory/economy state, rewards, matchmaking inputs, analytics events, social state, or session/lobby state unless you have first recorded why the native service cannot satisfy the requirement.

Per-engine code idioms (delegate vs. callback vs. coroutine vs. Promise) trace to the matching `references/sdks/game-engine/<engine>.md` or `references/sdks/web/typescript.md`.

When the detected project is Unreal and this subskill edits or verifies C++ files, read `references/sdks/game-engine/unreal-verification.md` before verification. If the Unreal Editor is already running and the Unreal SDK MCP tools are available, prefer `unreal_live_coding_compile`; otherwise use the normal Unreal build path when verification is required.

Auth integration is a specialization inside this subskill. For IAM work, always ground the flow in `references/modules/iam.md`, `references/integrate/auth-flow.md`, and, when login fails, `references/debug/auth-failures.md`.

For every AGS API integration, read `references/security/iam-authorization-preflight.md` and complete the authorization preflight before code edits. Caller type decides the token/client strategy. Select live permission discovery with the shared `accelbyte` policy: prefer AGS API MCP for overlapping remote discovery, and use AGS CLI when MCP is unavailable or lacks the required capability.

Don't fabricate SDK method signatures. When the user needs a specific signature, point at the SDK's docs / GitHub.

Do not treat backend/API/log success alone as player-flow completion. For game-facing integration requests, completion requires both service evidence and game-flow evidence from the player-facing trigger named in `../workflows/online-game-flow.md`.

Do not declare game integration complete from SDK calls, backend state, CLI output, or logs alone. Complete game integration requires the player-facing trigger and evidence contract from `../workflows/online-game-flow.md`.

</grounding_rules>

<tool_usage_rules>

- `Read` references for the module being wired and the matching SDK reference.
- `Read` any referenced wizard plan document under `docs/ags-plans/` before reading module references.
- `Glob` to locate the right files in the project (e.g. find the existing auth handler to wire AGS auth into).
- `Edit` / `Write` for code changes - summarize the intended edit scope before applying. Show a full diff only when the user asks, a harness approval flow requires it, or the change is too broad to summarize safely.
- AGS API MCP tools for overlapping remote authorization discovery when configured for the target environment.
- `Bash` for read-only AGS CLI authorization discovery when CLI is the selected path, and for build / smoke-test commands the user explicitly approves (compile, run, hit a test endpoint).
- Don't read other subskills.

</tool_usage_rules>

<dependency_checks>

Before wiring a module:

1. The SDK is installed and the test login passes (the selected AGS SDK subskill completed).
2. The authorization preflight from `references/security/iam-authorization-preflight.md` is complete:
   - caller type is known (`game client`, `game server`, `backend service`, `trusted tool`, or `web app/admin UI`);
   - token source is known (`user access token` for game-client calls, service/server token for game server / backend / trusted tooling);
   - IAM client kind matches the caller (`Public client` only for game-client login/bootstrap or browser-safe user flows; `Confidential` for game server / backend / trusted tooling);
   - planned SDK methods or REST endpoints are listed, including secondary calls such as profile/display-name lookups;
   - required permissions were discovered through the selected live tool, or the capability gap and allowed fallback are recorded;
   - configured client/token access is verified or the missing permission is named.
3. The Service Selection check is recorded:
   - desired player/game state or behavior is named;
   - the purpose-built AGS service is selected when one exists;
   - Cloud Save is selected only for generic key-value/save-blob storage, or when the native service is unavailable or insufficient and the reason is written down.
4. If the flow is game server / backend / trusted tooling and the configured client is Public, stop before implementation and route to `/ags connect-portal`.
5. If the module depends on another (Sessions on Matchmaking on Lobby on IAM), confirm the dependency is wired first.
6. For game projects, an approved Game Flow Plan exists unless the user explicitly requested smoke-only work.

If a precondition fails, surface it and route appropriately (`/ags connect-portal` for missing/placeholder IAM settings, login-method enablement, or IAM client scope changes; `/ags install-sdk` if the SDK isn't healthy).

When executing a wizard plan document, also confirm that the current code/config still matches the plan's `Confirmed Context`, `Affected Areas`, and `AGS Modules`. If the plan is stale, stop and ask whether to revise the plan with `/ags wizard` before editing code.

</dependency_checks>

<action_safety>

Edits user code. Specifically:

- Do not show a full diff by default. Summarize the target files and intended changes before applying code edits.
- For new files, show the full file before writing.
- For changes to auth-handling code (the most sensitive area), confirm with the user before applying.
- Test logins before declaring a module wired — don't claim success without a working call.
- Do not silently reinterpret a wizard plan. If the plan is ambiguous, ask for clarification before editing.
- If the active scope touches game-facing flow and no approved Game Flow Plan exists, stop before proposing or applying edits.

</action_safety>

<output_contract>

End each module with a "wired" mini-summary:

```
[Module] wired

  Files touched:    <list>
  Flow status:      <Smoke-verified | Game-flow integrated | Complete>
  Game trigger:     <UI action, input, console command, gameplay path, or "not implemented">
  Authorization:    <caller, token source, IAM client type, required permissions, verified access>
  Verification:     <service evidence and game-flow evidence>
  Module-specific:  <module-specific notes>

Next module: <name> (or "stop and run the game to verify, then come back")
```

After all requested modules are wired, end with:

```
Integration session complete.

  Modules wired this session:  <list>
  Modules still pending:       <list>
  Recommended next session:    <next module>
```

</output_contract>

<completeness_contract>

A module is "wired" when:

1. The relevant SDK calls are in the project at sensible places.
2. A smoke test exercises the module end-to-end (e.g. for Lobby: connect to lobby, send a message, receive presence update).
3. The smoke test passes.

For player-facing game integration requests, use the completion vocabulary from `../workflows/online-game-flow.md`:
- `Smoke-verified` when backend/API/log evidence shows the service path works but no proven player-facing trigger exists yet.
- `Game-flow integrated` when the player-facing trigger exists and runs the flow, but the final requested end state was not fully verified through that path.
- `Complete` only when the requested end state is reached through the intended player-facing path with both service evidence and game-flow evidence.

A session is "complete" when the requested integration is either reported with the correct flow status or the user has hit the limit of what they want done in one sitting.

</completeness_contract>

## Workflow

### Wizard plan document flow

Use this flow when the user says to integrate from a wizard plan, references a file under `docs/ags-plans/`, or says "use the plan" and exactly one plan exists.

1. **Find the plan document**:
   - If the user gives a path, read that file.
   - If the user gives a feature name, `Glob` `docs/ags-plans/*.md` and pick the matching file, asking if multiple match.
   - If no plan can be found, stop and ask the user to run `/ags wizard` first.
2. **Read the wizard plan document** before reading module references. Extract:
   - `Approved feature`
   - `Confirmed Context`
   - `Goal`
   - `Non-Goals`
   - `Affected Areas`
   - `AGS Modules`
   - `Implementation Steps`
   - `Verification`
   - `Risks And Open Questions`
3. **Validate current prerequisites** against the plan:
   - SDK/plugin setup still exists.
   - AGS config still contains real base URL, namespace, and client ID.
   - The affected files/areas still exist or have clear replacements.
   - Required AGS module references exist in this skill.
4. **Mirror plan steps into the host-native progress tracker**:
   - Convert each item in `Implementation Steps` into a host-native progress tracker step. If the harness has no native tracker, keep the same steps as a visible checklist in the response.
   - Add one final verification step from the plan's `Verification` section if not already present.
   - Only one plan step may be `in_progress` at a time.
   - Before starting a plan step, update it to `in_progress`.
   - After finishing and verifying it, update it to `completed`.
5. **Execute step by step**:
   - For each step, read the relevant module and SDK references.
   - Locate files via `Glob` / `Read`.
   - Summarize the intended edit scope before editing.
   - Apply edits only after confirmation when the step touches auth or broad shared code.
6. **Verify using the plan**:
   - Run the verification commands or smoke path described in the plan.
   - If verification differs from the plan because the project changed, explain the delta and ask before substituting another check.
7. **Summarize plan execution**:

```text
Wizard plan integrated.

  Plan:              docs/ags-plans/<file>.md
  Feature:           <approved feature>
  Files touched:     <list>
  Verification:      <result>
  Follow-up:         <remaining risk / next module / none>
```

If the plan includes multiple modules, execute only the approved feature slice unless the user explicitly asks to continue into the next slice.

### Module wiring order (default)

```
   1. IAM            (auth flow — required for everything else)
   2. Lobby          (party / presence / chat — listed as "Parties & Presence" and "Chat" in the live docs navigation)
   3. Session        (game session creation, server allocation)
   4. Matchmaking    (rule submission and ticket lifecycle)
   5. Store          (catalog browse, purchase flow)
   6. Statistics     (stat update, stat readback, cycles when needed)
   7. Leaderboards   (score posting / stat ranking queries)
   8. Achievements   (criteria evaluation, unlock handling)
   9. Social         (friends, blocking, notifications)
  10. Analytics      (custom event emission)
```

This order respects dependencies — IAM is the basis for everything; Matchmaking depends on Session (when a match is found, Matchmaking requests a game session from AGS Session), and Session depends on Lobby; Leaderboards depend on Statistics statcodes, while cycles apply only for seasonal leaderboards. Achievements depend on Statistics statcodes for incremental/global criteria.

Cloud Save is intentionally absent from the default order. Add it only after the service-selection check proves the requested data is generic save data or a purpose-built module cannot model it. When in doubt, use this bias:

- Scores, XP, MMR, counters, seasonal progress, ranked inputs, match results -> Statistics first.
- Rankings -> Leaderboards backed by Statistics where applicable.
- Milestones and unlocks -> Achievements or Challenges, often backed by Statistics.
- Purchases, wallet, catalog, grants, entitlements, rewards, season-pass progress -> Store/Entitlements, Rewards, or Season Pass.
- Items owned or acquired by a player -> Inventory or Store/Entitlements.
- Terms, EULA, privacy, age gate, consent, data export/erasure -> Legal or GDPR.
- Friends, blocks, presence, party state, notifications -> Lobby-backed social/multiplayer services.
- Session membership, joinability, reconnect, server allocation -> Session, Matchmaking, or AMS.
- Telemetry and product analytics -> Analytics / Game Telemetry.
- Free-form save slots, local-game snapshots, player settings, unstructured drafts, or custom opaque JSON with no native AGS integration -> Cloud Save.

When the prompt combines progression, Statistics, and Achievements, wire Statistics as the source of progression first. For counter-style progression, prefer the native statistic-backed achievement path: configure or confirm an incrementing stat, update that stat from gameplay, then configure the achievement criterion to unlock from the stat value or threshold. Do not skip this option or route to custom achievement logic unless the requested rule cannot be represented by a statistic/cycle/event criterion.

For specific cross-module flows (Lobby → Matchmaking → Session → AMS), see `references/integrate/lobby-session.md`.

### IAM auth integration flow

When the requested module is IAM/auth/login, treat it as a focused auth integration inside this subskill:

1. **Confirm required tool** — use the approved Game Flow Plan's AGS config/tooling result and the shared `accelbyte` policy. Prefer AGS API MCP for overlapping remote IAM checks. Use AGS CLI when MCP is unavailable or lacks the required capability; when CLI is selected, verify `ags --version` or `ags describe` (`ags --help` only as a fallback) and route to `/ags install-cli` if it is missing. Stop on auth, authorization, consent, or confirmation failures instead of switching paths.
2. **Confirm related service** — IAM is the only AGS service in scope for the first auth slice. Defer Lobby, Matchmaking, Store, and other module wiring until login is verified.
3. **Confirm SDK prerequisite** — use `/ags install-sdk` for Unreal, Unity, Godot, Roblox, Web SDK, and custom-engine REST fallback. Do not call the Unreal SDK MCP `install_unreal_sdk` tool from this integration flow.
4. **Read the auth docs** — read `references/modules/iam.md` and `references/integrate/auth-flow.md` before editing. If a login attempt already fails, also read `references/debug/auth-failures.md`.
5. **Check platform credentials** — identify the requested login method (Steam, PSN, Xbox, Epic, Apple, Google, Google Play Games, Facebook, Discord, Twitch, Snapchat, Oculus, Microsoft, OIDC, AWS Cognito, Nintendo, device/headless, email/password, etc.), read `references/platforms/auth-provider-configuration.md`, then verify the namespace, public IAM client, login-method enablement, provider-owned values, redirect/config values, and engine config are real rather than placeholders. Route to `/ags connect-portal` for missing or unclear AGS-side IAM setup. If provider-owned values are missing, stop and ask the user for the exact values listed in the provider reference instead of adding login code.
6. **Wire game login logic** — locate the existing login/bootstrap/auth handler, add the minimal SDK login call using the engine's idioms, and keep token/session handling aligned with the project.
7. **Run the smoke test** — build or run the smallest available auth path. IAM is wired only when login returns an AGS token and a second authenticated call, such as current-user/profile lookup, succeeds.

### Per-module flow

For each module the user wants wired:

1. **Read** the matching `references/modules/<name>.md` and the relevant `references/integrate/<flow>.md`.
2. **Locate** the right place in the project (existing auth handler, existing matchmaking entry, etc.) using `Glob`.
3. **Show the wiring scope** as target files and intended changes. Show a full diff only when the user asks, a harness approval flow requires it, or the change is too broad to summarize safely.
4. **Apply** the change.
5. **Test** — run the smoke-test call for the module:
   - IAM: `Login` → token returned → second authenticated call works.
   - Lobby: `Connect` → presence event received.
   - Matchmaking: submit ticket → match formed (in dev with prepopulated tickets) or ticket queued.
   - Session: create / join → roster lookup OK.
   - Store: list catalog → at least one item returned (assuming dev catalog has items).
   - Statistics: update stat item → readback returns the new value; for cycle-backed stats, cycle item lookup returns the expected active-cycle value.
   - Leaderboards: post score or update backing stat → rank lookup returns the new score/rank.
   - Achievements: for statistic-backed achievements, increment the backing stat → read stat/progress back → unlock event observed at the configured threshold; for non-stat criteria, trigger criteria → unlock event observed.
   - Social: add friend → friend list returns the new entry.
   - Analytics: emit custom event → confirmed in event browser or via CLI.
6. **Print** the "wired" mini-summary.
7. **Decide** next module with the user.

### When to hand off mid-session

| Situation | Hand off |
|---|---|
| User asks about matchmaking rule design / MMR tuning mid-session | Stop here, route to `/ags matchmaking` |
| User asks about AMS fleet config | Stop here, route to `/ags ams` |
| User asks for custom backend logic | Stop here, route to `/ags-extend ask` |
| Test fails repeatedly with auth errors | Route to `subskills/debug.md` or `references/debug/auth-failures.md` |
| Test fails with non-auth errors | Route to `subskills/debug.md` |

## Examples

### IAM auth flow (Unreal)

```
User: /ags integrate — start with IAM.

Skill: [reads references/modules/iam.md and references/integrate/auth-flow.md;
        looks up the current Unreal SDK login API in the SDK's docs/repo]
       Located: Source/MyGame/Private/MyAuthHandler.cpp

       Proposed AGS login wiring scope (using the current Unreal SDK
       login signature — exact symbol pulled from the SDK's docs, not
       quoted in this skill since it varies by SDK version):
         + [include the Unreal SDK's User-API header]
         + [call the SDK's Login* API with platform credentials and
            success/error delegates]
       Confirm? (y/n)

User: y

Skill: ✓ Applied change to MyAuthHandler.cpp
       ✓ Compiled.
       ✓ Smoke test: ran the editor, triggered login, got a token,
         called the get-current-user API — returned non-empty user_id.

       IAM wired

         Files touched:    Source/MyGame/Private/MyAuthHandler.cpp
         Verification:     login → token → GetMyProfile OK
         Module-specific:  Public IAM client; Steam IdP path will
                           be added when you wire Lobby.

       Next module: Lobby (or stop here and run the game to verify)
```

### Mid-session handoff

```
User: ...actually how do I tune the MMR formula?

Skill: That's matchmaking depth — wrong subskill. Stop /ags integrate
       here and run /ags matchmaking when you're ready to design the rule
       set and tune MMR. The current Matchmaking wiring (ticket submit
       and result handling) is what /ags integrate covers; the rule and
       MMR side belongs in /ags matchmaking.

       Want to keep going with the next module here, or stop?
```

## Error handling

- **Test fails after applying a code edit** — surface the error; route to `subskills/debug.md` if it's not obvious.
- **User wants to skip IAM and go straight to Lobby** — explain that without IAM, Lobby calls fail. Confirm IAM is at least minimally wired before continuing.
- **Module the user names doesn't exist** (e.g. "wire AccelByte Voice") — say so; name the closest fit; route to Extend if applicable.
