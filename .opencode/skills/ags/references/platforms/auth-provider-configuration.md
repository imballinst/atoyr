# Platform Auth Provider Configuration

Provider-side identity setup is a human handoff gate. The agent must not invent
platform credentials, create placeholder provider JSON, or continue into game
login code when the requested provider is not configured. Stop, ask for the
provider values listed below, and give the official setup reference.

For game-flow planning, provider setup is also a plan-approval gate. If the
requested third-party login provider is missing or inactive, do not ask the user
to approve the Game Flow Plan yet. First ask the user to manually add and
activate the provider in the AGS Admin Portal.

The common AGS Admin Portal path is:

`Game Setup > 3rd Party Configuration > Auth & Account Linking > Add New > <Provider> > Create > Activate`

When AGS CLI or project config reveals both the base URL and namespace, also
construct the direct Admin Portal URL:

`<ags-base-url-without-trailing-slash>/admin/namespaces/<namespace>/login-methods`

Example: `https://prod.gamingservices.accelbyte.io/admin/namespaces/gamestudio-bytewars/login-methods`

If the portal version differs, look for IAM platform credentials or login
methods. For CLI-backed mutation, still discover the exact command and body
with `ags describe` / `--skeleton`; use this file to decide which user-owned
values must already exist before any mutation.

Use this handoff shape before plan approval:

```text
Required AGS Admin Portal setup before plan approval:

1. Open: <direct Admin Portal URL>
2. Add provider: <Portal option>
3. Populate these fields:
   - <provider-specific field 1>
   - <provider-specific field 2>
4. Create/save the provider and set it active.
5. Tell me when this is done so I can run a read-only provider check and then
   ask for Game Flow Plan approval.
```

Do not collapse this to "confirm provider setup." Show the direct URL and the
fields the user needs to populate. For confidentiality-limited providers, say
that the public docs do not expose the exact field names, then ask the user to
fill every required field from the confidential AccelByte/platform-holder guide
or paste the portal field labels for review.

## Coverage Rules

- AGS Shared Cloud supports in-game login for the providers listed on the
  authentication overview, but web login is not supported there.
- Web login setup in these guides is Private Cloud / publisher-namespace work
  unless the specific provider guide says otherwise.
- Device ID is for development and debugging unless the game deliberately
  accepts account-loss risk. Prompt the user to plan account upgrade/linking.
- Console and confidentiality-limited providers require the user, AccelByte
  Technical Producer, platform representative, or confidential guide to provide
  missing platform fields. Do not infer those fields.

## Provider Stop Points

Use the "ask the user for" list as the handoff prompt before trying AGS
