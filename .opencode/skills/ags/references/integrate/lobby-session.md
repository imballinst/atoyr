# Integrate — Lobby ↔ Session

End-to-end shape for going from "two players in a party" to "two players connected in a game session". Three AGS modules plus either P2P session travel or, for dedicated-server outcomes, usually AMS.

## The flow

```
   ┌── Lobby ──────────────────────────┐
   │                                   │
   │   Players form a party            │
   │   (invites, accept, presence)     │
   │                                   │
   └──────────────┬────────────────────┘
                  │ Party leader submits matchmaking ticket
                  ▼
   ┌── Matchmaking ────────────────────┐
   │                                   │
   │   Ticket queued                   │
   │   Rule set evaluates pool         │
   │   Match formed when constraints   │
   │   are satisfied                   │
   │                                   │
   └──────────────┬────────────────────┘
                  │ Match confirmed
                  ▼
   ┌── Session Management ─────────────┐
   │                                   │
   │   Game session created            │
   │   Players join session            │
   │   Server allocation triggered     │
   │   when min player count reached   │
   │                                   │
   └──────────────┬────────────────────┘
                  │ Allocation request
                  ▼
   ┌── AMS (or studio's own fleet) ────┐
   │                                   │
   │   Server allocated                │
   │   Endpoint returned to Session    │
   │                                   │
   └──────────────┬────────────────────┘
                  │ Server endpoint

   ┌── Session Management ─────────────┐
   │                                   │
   │   Players notified                │
   │   Game clients connect to server  │
   │                                   │

## Where each module's responsibility ends

- **Lobby** — owns party state, presence, chat, invites. Once matchmaking takes over, Lobby tracks the transition but doesn't drive match formation.
- **Matchmaking** — owns the rule set and ticket lifecycle. Once a match is confirmed, hands off to Session Management.
- **Session Management** — owns the session wrapper end-to-end (creation through completion). Tracks roster, handles reconnection, and carries either dedicated-server or P2P session connection details.
- **AMS** — owns server fleet operations. Returns a server endpoint when allocated.

For matchmaking depth (rule design, MMR, ticket lifecycle), hand off to `/ags matchmaking`. For AMS operational work, route to `/ags ams`.

For Unreal P2P, read `references/sdks/game-engine/unreal-p2p.md` before implementing travel. The P2P path requires Session V2, `AccelByteNetworkUtilities`, `GameNetDriver` config, and explicit host/member `ClientTravel(...)` handling after `JoinSession(...)`.

## Common gotchas

- **Reconnection windows** — Session has a configurable window for a dropped player to rejoin. Set this carefully; too short and you punish flaky networks, too long and you tie up server capacity.
- **Stale party → match transitions** — if a party member leaves between matchmaking submission and match confirmation, the rule set may stop being satisfied. Exact behavior (re-queue, match failure, or proceed) varies — test against your AGS version to confirm.
- **Server endpoint propagation** — game clients need the server endpoint promptly after allocation. Session Management notifies players of the server endpoint; ensure the session notification channel is healthy at this moment.
- **Crossplay matchmaking** — region routing must respect platform-policy constraints (e.g. PSN ↔ Xbox crossplay rules apply at platform-level, not AGS-level).

## When custom logic is needed

- Custom matchmaking decision (priority, scoring, segmentation) → Extend Override; route to `/ags matchmaking` first to confirm native rules can't express it, then `/ags-extend ask`.
- Custom backfill → Extend Service Extension or Event Handler; route to `/ags-extend ask`.
- Custom server fleet (non-AMS) → integration is on the studio side; AGS Session Management exposes hooks for allocation callbacks.
