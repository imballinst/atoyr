# SDK — Godot

The AGS **Godot SDK** for game clients and dedicated game servers built on Godot Engine. Note: the Godot SDK is not listed in the main AGS docs portal (setup-game-sdk page) — confirm SDK status and GitHub URL before recommending it to a studio. Wraps the same AGS REST + OpenAPI surface as the Unreal and Unity SDKs.

> **Versions move.** Confirm the supported Godot engine version range against `https://docs.accelbyte.io/` and the SDK's GitHub release notes.

## What's in scope here

- Installation paths: addon install via Godot Asset Library / GitHub release, or a manual copy of the SDK addon directory into the project. (Verify the GitHub release URL and Godot Asset Library status — no public AGS docs source confirmed.)
- Module shape: services exposed per AGS module (IAM, Lobby, Matchmaking, …) — same logical layout as the other Game Engine SDKs.
- Convention: signal-based async, fitting Godot's idioms. (Unverified — confirm against SDK GitHub README.)
- Build target shape: client builds use a public IAM client; dedicated server builds use a confidential IAM client with a server secret.

`subskills/install-sdk.md` is the operational guide for installing and scaffolding into a project. This file is the conceptual "what is the Godot SDK?" reference.

## Notes

- Godot 4.x and Godot 3.x have meaningful differences in scripting and signal APIs; the SDK release notes specify which Godot major version is supported.
- The Godot SDK is the newest Game Engine SDK in the AGS family — feature parity with Unreal / Unity may lag for new AGS capabilities; check release notes for any module-specific gaps.

## Where this SDK ends

- **Non-Godot engines** — integrate via REST + OpenAPI, not the Godot SDK.
- **Extend SDKs** (Go / Python / C# / Java) — unrelated; for Extend apps. Owned by `/ags-extend`.

## Where to look in the docs
